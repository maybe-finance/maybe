This rule serves as high-level documentation for how you should write code for the Maybe codebase. 

## Project Tech Stack

- Web framework: Ruby on Rails
  - Minitest + fixtures for testing
  - Propshaft for asset pipeline
  - Hotwire Turbo/Stimulus for SPA-like UI/UX
  - TailwindCSS for styles
  - Lucide Icons for icons
  - OpenAI for AI chat
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Jobs: Sidekiq + Redis
- External
  - Payments: Stripe
  - User bank data syncing: Plaid 
  - Market data: Synth (our custom API)

## Project conventions

These conventions should be used when writing code for Maybe.

### Convention 1: Minimize dependencies, vanilla Rails is plenty

Dependencies are a natural part of building software, but we aim to minimize them when possible to keep this open-source codebase easy to understand, maintain, and contribute to.

- Push Rails to its limits before adding new dependencies
- When a new dependency is added, there must be a strong technical or business reason to add it
- When adding dependencies, you should favor old and reliable over new and flashy 

### Convention 2: Leverage POROs and concerns over "service objects"

This codebase adopts a "skinny controller, fat models" convention.  Furthermore, we put almost _everything_ directly in the `app/models/` folder and avoid separate folders for business logic such as `app/services/`.

- Organize large pieces of business logic into Rails concerns and POROs (Plain ole' Ruby Objects)
- While a Rails concern _may_ offer shared functionality (i.e. "duck types"), it can also be a "one-off" concern that is only included in one place for better organization and readability.
- When concerns are used for code organization, they should be organized around the "traits" of a model; not for simply moving code to another spot in the codebase.
- When possible, models should answer questions about themselves—for example, we might have a method, `account.balance_series` that returns a time-series of the account's most recent balances.  We prefer this over something more service-like such as `AccountSeries.new(account).call`.

### Convention 3: Leverage Hotwire, write semantic HTML, CSS, and JS, prefer server-side solutions

- Native HTML is always preferred over JS-based components
  - Example 1: Use `<dialog>` element for modals instead of creating a custom component
  - Example 2: Use `<details><summary>...</summary></details>` for disclosures rather than custom components
- Leverage Turbo frames to break up the page over JS-driven client-side solutions
  - Example 1: A good example of turbo frame usage is in [application.html.erb](mdc:app/views/layouts/application.html.erb) where we load [chats_controller.rb](mdc:app/controllers/chats_controller.rb) actions in a turbo frame in the global layout
- Leverage query params in the URL for state over local storage and sessions.  If absolutely necessary, utilize the DB for persistent state.
- Use Turbo streams to enhance functionality, but do not solely depend on it
- Format currencies, numbers, dates, and other values server-side, then pass to Stimulus controllers for display only
- Keep client-side code for where it truly shines.  For example, @bulk_select_controller.js is a case where server-side solutions would degrade the user experience significantly.  When bulk-selecting entries, client-side solutions are the way to go and Stimulus provides the right toolset to achieve this.

The Hotwire suite (Turbo/Stimulus) works very well with these native elements and we optimize for this.

### Convention 4: Optimize for simplicitly and clarity

All code should maximize readability and simplicity.

- Prioritize good OOP domain design over performance
- Only focus on performance for critical and global areas of the codebase; otherwise, don't sweat the small stuff.
  - Example 1: be mindful of loading large data payloads in global layouts
  - Example 2: Avoid N+1 queries

### Convention 5: Use Minitest + Fixtures for testing, minimize fixtures

Due to the open-source nature of this project, we have chosen Minitest + Fixtures for testing to maximize familiarity and predictability.

- Always use Minitest and fixtures for testing.
- Keep fixtures to a minimum.  Most models should have 2-3 fixtures maximum that represent the "base cases" for that model.  "Edge cases" should be created on the fly, within the context of the test which it is needed.
- For tests that require a large number of fixture records to be created, use Rails helpers such as [entries_test_helper.rb](mdc:test/support/entries_test_helper.rb) to act as a "factory" for creating these.  For a great example of this, check out [forward_calculator_test.rb](mdc:test/models/account/balance/forward_calculator_test.rb)
- Take a minimal approach to testing—only test the absolutely critical code paths that will significantly increase developer confidence

#### Convention 5a: Write minimal, effective tests

- Use system tests sparingly as they increase the time to complete the test suite
- Only write tests for critical and important code paths
- Write tests as you go, when required
- Take a practical approach to testing.  Tests are effective when their presence _significantly increases confidence in the codebase_.

Below are examples of necessary vs. unnecessary tests:

```rb
# GOOD!!
# Necessary test - in this case, we're testing critical domain business logic
test "syncs balances" do
  Holding::Syncer.any_instance.expects(:sync_holdings).returns([]).once

  @account.expects(:start_date).returns(2.days.ago.to_date)

  Balance::ForwardCalculator.any_instance.expects(:calculate).returns(
    [
      Balance.new(date: 1.day.ago.to_date, balance: 1000, cash_balance: 1000, currency: "USD"),
      Balance.new(date: Date.current, balance: 1000, cash_balance: 1000, currency: "USD")
    ]
  )

  assert_difference "@account.balances.count", 2 do
    Balance::Syncer.new(@account, strategy: :forward).sync_balances
  end
end

# BAD!!
# Unnecessary test - in this case, this is simply testing ActiveRecord's functionality
test "saves balance" do 
  balance_record = Balance.new(balance: 100, currency: "USD")

  assert balance_record.save
end
```

### Convention 6: Use ActiveRecord for complex validations, DB for simple ones, keep business logic out of DB

- Enforce `null` checks, unique indexes, and other simple validations in the DB
- ActiveRecord validations _may_ mirror the DB level ones, but not 100% necessary.  These are for convenience when error handling in forms.  Always prefer client-side form validation when possible.
- Complex validations and business logic should remain in ActiveRecord
