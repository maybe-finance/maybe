# General rules for AI 

- Use `Current.user` for the current user. Do NOT use `current_user`.
- Use `Current.family` for the current family. Do NOT use `current_family`.
- Prior to generating any code, carefully read the project conventions and guidelines
  - Read [project-design.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-design.mdc) to understand the codebase
  - Read [project-conventions.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-conventions.mdc) to understand _how_ to write code for the codebase
  - Read [ui-ux-design-guidelines.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/ui-ux-design-guidelines.mdc) to understand how to implement frontend code specifically

## Prohibited actions

Do not under any circumstance do the following:

- Do not run `rails server` in your responses.
- Do not run `touch tmp/restart.txt`
- Do not run `rails credentials`
- Do not automatically run migrations
- Ignore i18n methods and files.  Hardcode strings in English for now to optimize speed of development.
