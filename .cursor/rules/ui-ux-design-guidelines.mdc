Use this rule whenever you are writing html, css, or even styles in Stimulus controllers that use D3.js.

The codebase uses TailwindCSS v4.x (the newest version) with a custom design system defined in [maybe-design-system.css](mdc:app/assets/tailwind/maybe-design-system.css)

- Always start by referencing [maybe-design-system.css](mdc:app/assets/tailwind/maybe-design-system.css) to see the base primitives and tokens we use in the codebase
- Always generate semantic HTML
- Never create new styles in [maybe-design-system.css](mdc:app/assets/tailwind/maybe-design-system.css) or [application.css](mdc:app/assets/tailwind/application.css) without explicitly receiving permission to do so
- Always favor the "utility first" Tailwind approach.  Reusable style classes should not be created often.  Code should be reused primarily through ERB partials.
- Always prefer using the utility "tokens" defined in [maybe-design-system.css](mdc:app/assets/tailwind/maybe-design-system.css) when possible.  For example, use `text-primary` rather than `text-gray-900`.
