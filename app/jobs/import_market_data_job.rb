# This job runs daily at market close.  See config/schedule.yml for details.
#
# The primary purpose of this job is to:
# 1. Determine what exchange rate pairs, security prices, and other market data all of our users need to view historical account balance data
# 2. For each needed rate/price, fetch from our data provider and upsert to our database
#
# Each individual account sync will still fetch any missing market data that isn't yet synced, but by running
# this job daily, we significantly reduce overlapping account syncs that both need the same market data (e.g. common security like `AAPL`)
