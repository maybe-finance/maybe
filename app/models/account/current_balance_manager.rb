    # Manual accounts do not manage the `current_anchor` valuation (otherwise, user would need to continually update it, which is bad UX)
    # Instead, we use a combination of "auto-update strategies" to set the current balance according to the user's intent.
    #
    # The "auto-update strategies" are:
    # 1. Value tracking - If the account has a reconciliation already, we assume they are tracking the account value primarily with reconciliations, so we append a new one
    # 2. Transaction adjustment - If the account doesn't have recons, we assume user is tracking with transactions, so we adjust the opening balance with a delta until it
    #                             gets us to the desired balance. This ensures we don't append unnecessary reconciliations to the account, which "reset" the value from that
    #                             date forward (not user's intent).
    #
    # For more documentation on these auto-update strategies, see the test cases.
