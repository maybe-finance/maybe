- `bin/rails server` - Start Rails server only
- `bin/rails console` - Open Rails console

### Testing
- `bin/rails test` - Run all tests
- `bin/rails test:db` - Run tests with database reset
- `bin/rails test:system` - Run system tests only
- `bin/rails test test/models/account_test.rb` - Run specific test file
- `bin/rails test test/models/account_test.rb:42` - Run specific test at line

### Linting & Formatting
- `bin/rubocop` - Run Ruby linter
- `npm run lint` - Check JavaScript/TypeScript code
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix JavaScript/TypeScript issues
- `npm run format` - Format JavaScript/TypeScript code
- `bin/brakeman` - Run security analysis

### Database
- `bin/rails db:prepare` - Create and migrate database
- `bin/rails db:migrate` - Run pending migrations
- `bin/rails db:rollback` - Rollback last migration
- `bin/rails db:seed` - Load seed data

### Setup
- `bin/setup` - Initial project setup (installs dependencies, prepares database)

## General Development Rules

### Authentication Context
- Use `Current.user` for the current user. Do NOT use `current_user`.
- Use `Current.family` for the current family. Do NOT use `current_family`.

### Development Guidelines
- Prior to generating any code, carefully read the project conventions and guidelines
- Ignore i18n methods and files. Hardcode strings in English for now to optimize speed of development
- Do not run `rails server` in your responses
- Do not run `touch tmp/restart.txt`
- Do not run `rails credentials`
- Do not automatically run migrations

## High-Level Architecture

### Application Modes
The Maybe app runs in two distinct modes:
- **Managed**: The Maybe team operates and manages servers for users (Rails.application.config.app_mode = "managed")
- **Self Hosted**: Users host the Maybe app on their own infrastructure, typically through Docker Compose (Rails.application.config.app_mode = "self_hosted")

### Core Domain Model
The application is built around financial data management with these key relationships:
- **User** → has many **Accounts** → has many **Transactions**
- **Account** types: checking, savings, credit cards, investments, crypto, loans, properties
- **Transaction** → belongs to **Category**, can have **Tags** and **Rules**
- **Investment accounts** → have **Holdings** → track **Securities** via **Trades**

### API Architecture
The application provides both internal and external APIs:
- Internal API: Controllers serve JSON via Turbo for SPA-like interactions
- External API: `/api/v1/` namespace with Doorkeeper OAuth and API key authentication
- API responses use Jbuilder templates for JSON rendering
- Rate limiting via Rack Attack with configurable limits per API key

### Sync & Import System
Two primary data ingestion methods:
1. **Plaid Integration**: Real-time bank account syncing
   - `PlaidItem` manages connections
   - `Sync` tracks sync operations
   - Background jobs handle data updates
2. **CSV Import**: Manual data import with mapping
   - `Import` manages import sessions
   - Supports transaction and balance imports
   - Custom field mapping with transformation rules

### Background Processing
Sidekiq handles asynchronous tasks:
- Account syncing (`SyncAccountsJob`)
- Import processing (`ImportDataJob`)
- AI chat responses (`CreateChatResponseJob`)
- Scheduled maintenance via sidekiq-cron

### Frontend Architecture
- **Hotwire Stack**: Turbo + Stimulus for reactive UI without heavy JavaScript
- **ViewComponents**: Reusable UI components in `app/components/`
- **Stimulus Controllers**: Handle interactivity, organized alongside components
- **Charts**: D3.js for financial visualizations (time series, donut, sankey)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4.x with custom design system
  - Design system defined in `app/assets/tailwind/maybe-design-system.css`
  - Always use functional tokens (e.g., `text-primary` not `text-white`)
  - Prefer semantic HTML elements over JS components
  - Use `icon` helper for icons, never `lucide_icon` directly

### Multi-Currency Support
- All monetary values stored in base currency (user's primary currency)
- Exchange rates fetched from Synth API
- `Money` objects handle currency conversion and formatting
- Historical exchange rates for accurate reporting

### Security & Authentication
- Session-based auth for web users
- API authentication via:
  - OAuth2 (Doorkeeper) for third-party apps
  - API keys with JWT tokens for direct API access
- Scoped permissions system for API access
- Strong parameters and CSRF protection throughout

### Key Service Objects & Patterns
- **Query Objects**: Complex database queries isolated in `app/queries/`
- **Service Objects**: Business logic in `app/services/`
- **Form Objects**: Complex forms with validation
- **Concerns**: Shared functionality across models/controllers
- **Jobs**: Background processing logic

### Testing Philosophy
- Comprehensive test coverage using Rails' built-in Minitest
- Fixtures for test data (avoid FactoryBot)
- Keep fixtures minimal (2-3 per model for base cases)
- VCR for external API testing
- System tests for critical user flows (use sparingly)
- Test helpers in `test/support/` for common scenarios
- Only test critical code paths that significantly increase confidence
- Write tests as you go, when required

### Performance Considerations
- Database queries optimized with proper indexes
- N+1 queries prevented via includes/joins
- Background jobs for heavy operations
- Caching strategies for expensive calculations
- Turbo Frames for partial page updates

### Development Workflow
- Feature branches merged to `main`
- Docker support for consistent environments
- Environment variables via `.env` files
- Lookbook for component development (`/lookbook`)
- Letter Opener for email preview in development

## Project Conventions

### Convention 1: Minimize Dependencies
- Push Rails to its limits before adding new dependencies
- When adding dependencies, favor old and reliable over new and flashy
- Strong technical or business reason required for new dependencies

### Convention 2: POROs and Concerns over Service Objects
- "Skinny controller, fat models" convention
- Everything in `app/models/` folder, avoid separate folders like `app/services/`
- Use Rails concerns for better organization (can be one-off concerns)
- Models should answer questions about themselves (e.g., `account.balance_series`)

### Convention 3: Leverage Hotwire and Server-Side Solutions
- Native HTML preferred over JS components (e.g., `<dialog>`, `<details>`)
- Use Turbo frames to break up pages
- Leverage query params for state over local storage
- Format values server-side, pass to Stimulus for display only
- Client-side code only where it truly shines (e.g., bulk selections)

### Convention 4: Optimize for Simplicity and Clarity
- Prioritize good OOP domain design over performance
- Only focus on performance in critical/global areas
- Be mindful of N+1 queries and large data payloads

### Convention 5: ActiveRecord for Complex Validations, DB for Simple Ones
- Enforce null checks, unique indexes in the DB
- ActiveRecord validations for convenience in forms
- Complex validations and business logic in ActiveRecord
