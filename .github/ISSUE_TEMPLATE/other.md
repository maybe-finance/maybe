## Before you start (required)

### Is this a bug?

A bug is _broken functionality_ of the app (i.e. it prevents you from using the app).  For bugs, please use the ["Bug Report" template](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/issues) instead.

### Is this a bug with _sensitive info_?

If you are a _paying_ Maybe user, you can open a support request in Intercom.

### Is this a feature request?

A feature request is functionality that you would like that is not already on our [Roadmap](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/wiki/Roadmap).

All feature requests should be opened in a [Feature request Discussion](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/discussions/categories/feature-requests).

Be sure to search existing discussions prior to opening a new feature request.

### Is this related to Docker and/or hosting for self hosting?

If you are having a Docker configuration issue, please do not open a Github issue unless you've identified a bug in our Dockerfile.  To get help with self hosting, there are several options:

- **First**: Read our [Docker hosting guide](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/tree/main/docs/hosting/docker.md) and follow it step-by-step
- Open a [Docker Discussion](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/discussions/categories/docker-compose-hosting)
