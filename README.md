# ~Maybe~Sure: The personal finance app for everyone

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is a community fork of the official (now abandoned) Maybe Finance one.  
> You can read more about this in Their [final release](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/releases/tag/v0.6.0) doc.

## Backstory

The Maybe Finance team spent the better part of 2021/2022 building a personal
finance + wealth management app called "Maybe". Very full-featured, including
an "Ask an Advisor" feature which connected users with an actual CFP/CFA to
help them with their finances (all included in your subscription).

The business end of things didn't work out, and so they shut things down mid-2023.

Having spent the better part of $1,000,000 building the app (employees +
contractors, data providers/services, infrastructure, etc.) they decided to
revive the product as a fully open-source project. The goal was to
let you run the app yourself, for free, and use it to manage your own finances
and eventually offer a hosted version of the app for a small monthly fee.

Which they did.  Offer a hosted version for a short while.

That didn't work either (well, the "making it a sustainable B2C business" part
didn't) so here we are hosting a community maintained fork hoping to keep the
codebase alive and who knows what else will come next.
