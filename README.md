## Backstory

We spent the better part of 2021/2022 building a personal finance + wealth management app called, Maybe. Very full-featured, including an "Ask an Advisor" feature which connected users with an actual CFP/CFA to help them with their finances (all included in your subscription).

The business end of things didn't work out, and so we shut things down mid-2023.

We spent the better part of $1,000,000 building the app (employees + contractors, data providers/services, infrastructure, etc.).

We're now reviving the product as a fully open-source project. The goal is to let you run the app yourself, for free, and use it to manage your own finances and eventually offer a hosted version of the app for a small monthly fee.

## Self Hosting

temp: trigger deploy

You can find [detailed setup guides for self hosting here](docs/self-hosting.md).

<img src="https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg" alt="Deploy to Render" />
</a>

1. Click the button above
2. Follow the instructions in the [Render self-hosting guide](docs/self-hosting/render.md)

## Local Development Setup

### Requirements

- Ruby >3 (see `Gemfile`)
- PostgreSQL >9.3 (ideally, latest stable version)

After cloning the repo, the basic setup commands are:

```sh
cd maybe
cp .env.example .env
bin/setup
bin/dev

# Optionally, load demo data
rake demo_data:reset
```

And visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app. You can use the following credentials to log in (generated by DB seed):

- Email: `user@maybe.local`
- Password: `password`

For further instructions, see guides below.

### Multi-currency support

If you'd like multi-currency support, there are a few extra steps to follow.

1. Sign up for an API key at [Synth](https://synthfinance.com). It's a Maybe product and the free plan is sufficient for basic multi-currency support.
2. Add your API key to your `.env` file.

### Setup Guides

#### Dev Container (optional)

This is 100% optional and meant for devs who don't want to worry about installing requirements manually for their platform. You can follow [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) to learn more about Dev Containers.

If you run into `could not connect to server` errors, you may need to change your `.env`'s `DB_HOST` environment variable value to `db` to point to the Postgres container.

#### Mac
