# Exchange Rate API
# This is used to convert between different currencies in the app. We're currently using Open Exchange Rates (openexchangerates.org) to sync exchange rate data and, at the moment, that requies a $12/mo subscription. This is NOT required to run Maybe with one currency, but it is required to sync exchange rate data if you need multiple currencies. In the future we'll be adding support for other exchange rate APIs that are cheaper/free.

# SMTP Configuration
# This is only needed if you intend on sending emails from your Maybe instance (such as for password resets or email financial reports).
# Resend.com is a good option that offers a free tier for sending emails.
